# Brainfuck interpreter

This is a small Brainfuck interpreter, written in Rust.

# How to use
To use this crate, one can implement the `Tape` and `TapeData` traits (or use an existing implementation, activated 
using the `impls` feature, which is on by default).

Alternatively, the `hello-world.rs` example can be edited with the program you wish to run.
